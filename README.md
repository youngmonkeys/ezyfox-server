## üìñ Introduction

An Open Solution for all your Real-Time needs.

To develop online games rapidly, developers often need to use a game server engine like SmartFoxServer or Photon. Unfortunately, these engines come with a high price tag, especially as more and more users engage with our products. That's why we developed the EzyFox ecosystem, which aims to be free and open for anyone interested in building multiplayer games and applications.

The EzyFox ecosystem supports a wide range of essential components for enterprise product development, including TCP, UDP, WebSocket protocols with SSL encryption, HTTP RESTful API, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol, Database Interaction, Memory Caching, and Message Queue.

With the EzyFox ecosystem, we can avoid the headache of choosing which technologies to use to manage and scale up an application, allowing us to focus solely on implementing business logic.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Core Container & Dependency Injection**: Includes bean manipulation, auto-binding, auto-implementation, and more.
* **Multiple Communication Protocols**: Supports TCP, UDP, WebSocket, and HTTP.
* **Traffic Encryption**: Allows for traffic between clients and servers to be encrypted using SSL.
* **Multiple Client SDKs**: Includes Android, iOS, Unity, React, C++, Flutter, and more.

## üî• Benchmark

Ezyfox Server's benchmark involved broadcasting messages to 1000 concurrent users in one hour on a VPS with 512MB of RAM and 1 CPU core. You can [watch this video](https://youtu.be/TiSLOWIid5o) to see how we conducted the test.

[Make a Meaningful Donation üòé](https://youngmonkeys.org/donate/)

Currently, our operating budget is fully supported by our own salaries, and all product development is still based on voluntary contributions from a few organization members. The low budget is causing significant difficulties for us. Therefore, with a clear roadmap and an ambitious goal to provide intellectual products for the community, we would greatly appreciate your support in the form of a donation to help us take further steps. Thank you in advance for your meaningful contributions!
